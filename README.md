## Movie Map 2

![Landing page](README.images/landingPage.png)

## Description

Our application helps film buffs receive personalized recommendations and information on how to watch their finds, without having to search through multiple apps, websites, and subscription services. Using various film APIs we were able to create an app that allows for registered users to receive tailored film recommendations, with information for how to watch the recommended films. In addition, registered users can save their searches and create watchlists. Movie Map saves time by being a one stop film search engine.

## Motivation

We had the idea for Movie Map when a teammate found themselves having to flip through each of their media subscriptions for a film to watch and then having to flip back and forth to narrow down the search and find a film that was interesting. They figured having a web app where they could receive tailored film recommendations and the immediate information on where to watch them would save time they could spend, well, watching movies.

## Results

Using various film APIs we were able to create an app that allows registered users to receive tailored film recommendations with information and links for how to watch each film. In addition, registered users can save their searches, create watchlists, and make modifications to their user account. Non-registered users can still use the app as a film search engine. Movie Map saves time by being a one stop film search engine.
